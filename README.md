# Human_or_Robot_Challenge

We take on the kaggle classification competition Human or Robot, which was hosted by Facebook in 2014. 

We are given two tabular datasets, one containing labels, and another containing potential features. 

The goal is to produce an algorithm that can faithfully discern the difference in bidding activity between humans and bots.

After some basic feature engineering, we find that statistical learning algorithms do far better than basic neural networks implemented via Keras.
